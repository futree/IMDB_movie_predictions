# IMDB_movie_predictions

Is it possible to predict the popularity of a movie prior to its release based on certain characteristics of the movie, to be specific are variables such as movie genre, MPAA rating, run length, etc. good predictors of a popular movie? The [dataset](https://stat.duke.edu/~mc301/data/movies.Rdata) contains information about movies in Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB. There are 651 randomly sampled movies produced and released before 2016. I fit a model using backward stepwise regression to predict future ratings based on basic imdb features.
